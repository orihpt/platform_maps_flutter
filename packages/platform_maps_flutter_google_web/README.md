# platform_maps_flutter_google_web

This is the Google Maps for Web implementation of the `platform_maps_flutter` plugin.
If you add `platform_maps_flutter` to your pubspec.yaml this will automatically be used.

It's Web only to prevent iOS & Android dependencies for Google Maps being added to your project.
